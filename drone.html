          <p class="aboutme">Ever since people started farming and growing food they have always looked for ways to increase crop yield. Therefore, large scale manufacturers use fertilizer, primarily nitrogen based fertilizers using the Habor-Bosh process since its advent in 1909. The benefit of fertilizer is to repel bugs and other creatures from eating the crops, thus, boosting crop yield, as well as, adding nutrients for plants to grow quicker. The problem is that spraying fertilizer is only 10-30% effective, meaning that the plants only absorb 10-30% of the fertilizers. This leaves 60-90% of fertilizers in runoff polluting streams, rivers, lakes, etc. The gradual increase of nitrogen and phosphorus levels in bodies of water from fertilizer runoff promote rapid growth of algae called algae blooms, a consequence of eutrophication. As the large amount of algae die, microorganisms rapidly consume the algae leading to the deoxygenation of water and death of animals within the bodies of water. 
            <p></p>
  The goal of this project is to detect and analyze algae in water to better long term environmental analysis. By creating a cheaper and simpler alternative to current algae detection methods, clients can manage, detect, and track algae patterns within their own bodies of water. Our design will capture multispectral images of water by drone flight and then analyzed through an ARCGis Pro plugin we have programmed.

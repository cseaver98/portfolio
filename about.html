          <p class="aboutme">Hello, I'm Charles Seaver! I'm currently a senior at James Madison University majoring in engineering with minors in computer science, robotics, and mathematics. I plan on graduating in Spring of 2021 then gain more experience in the robotics/AI field.</p><p> During my undergraduate studies, I have been learning statics/dynamics, thermodynamics, circuits, etc. I was enjoying myself, solving mentally stimulating problems were stressful but very rewarding. However I felt like I was missing a piece of me that had a passion in computers. So I decided to learn programming during my freetime. I started learning Java and C++, and then I bought my first arduino and raspberry pi. I created projects using these devices, and I was really enjoying myself. During this time I thought to myself that I wanted to pursue a career in robotics/AI, where I can combine my engineering and programming skills. </p><p> To help jump start my robotics career, I picked up a Robotics Minor for my last year as an undergraduate. I will be taking courses covering autonomous robots, mobile robots, mechatronics, and artificial intelligence. I will update my site about these experiences.

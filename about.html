          <p class="aboutme">Hello, I'm Charles Seaver! I'm currently a senior at James Madison University majoring in engineering with minors in computer science, robotics, and mathematics. I plan on graduating in Spring of 2021 and then seeking out opportunities to gain more experience in the robotics/AI field.</p>
          <p> During my undergraduate studies, I have been learning statics/dynamics, thermodynamics, circuits, etc. I've really been enjoying myself &#8212; solving mentally-stimulating problems have been stressful but always very rewarding. However, there was a point in which I felt like I was missing a piece of me that had a passion in computers. As a result, I decided to learn how to program during my freetime. I started learning Java and C++, and then I bought my first Arduino and raspberry pi. I had a lot of fun creating projects using these devices. During this time, I thought to myself that I wanted to pursue a career in robotics/AI or controls engineering, where I can combine my engineering and programming skills. </p>
          <p> To help jumpstart my robotics career, I picked up a Robotics minor for my last year as an undergraduate. I will be taking courses covering autonomous robots, mobile robots, mechatronics, and artificial intelligence. These experiences will be updated on my portfolio as I journey through them.
